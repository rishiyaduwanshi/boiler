Store a folder/file as snippet or stack

### Synopsis

Store a file as a snippet or directory as a stack in your Boiler store.

Files are stored as snippets with version numbers.
Directories must have a boiler.stack.json config file (run 'bl init' first).

Version Management:
  If snippet already exists, you'll be prompted with options:
    (o) Overwrite - Replace the latest version with new content
    (n) New version - Create a new incremental version
    (c) Cancel - Abort the operation
  First-time storage automatically creates version 1

Stacks require boiler.stack.json with:
  - id: Stack name
  - version: Version number
  - ignore: Patterns to exclude

If a stack version already exists, you'll be prompted to overwrite.

```
bl store [path] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Store current directory as stack
  bl store

  # Store specific file as snippet (first version)
  bl store ./utils/logger.js
  # Output: ✓ Stored snippet 'logger@1.js'

  # Store again - prompts for action
  bl store ./utils/logger.js
  # Prompt: Snippet 'logger' already exists (1 version(s)). Options:
  #   (o) Overwrite latest version (1)
  #   (n) Create new version (2)
  #   (c) Cancel

  # Store directory as stack
  bl store ./my-template

  # Store with custom name
  bl store ./config.js --name dbConfig.js
```

  -d, --description string   Description
  -h, --help                 help for store
      --name string          Name for the resource (auto-detected from path if not provided)
